# Exploring the Effectiveness of Generating Log Statements in Test Codes

In this study, we empirically investigate various logging-specific PLMs and general-/code-specific LLMs with different learning strategies (e.g., in-context leraning, instruction tuning) for generating test log statements. This is a replication package for our empirical study.

#### Dataset
The dataset for pre-training, fine-tuning/instruction-tuning (train, val, and test set), and in-context learning can be found as this link:
